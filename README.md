# Excel-Coffee-Shop-Dashboard
##The Situation
You've recently become a franchise owner at Maven Roaster, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City
To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, I've collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023.

My goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

THE OBJECTIVES
1. Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis
2. Explore the data with Excel PivotTables
3. Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends

OBJECTIVE 1: PREPARE THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS

- Familiarize with the data: How many transactions were recorded, over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold?
- Add a new column to calculate Revenue (price * quantity)
- Add new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date
- Add new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date
- Display them as text (i.e. "Jan", "Feb", "Sun", "Mon"), instead of numerical values
- Add a new column to extract Hour from the transaction time

OBJECTIVE 2: EXPLORE THE DATA WITH PIVOT TABLES

- Insert a PivotTable on a new tab to show revenue by month
- Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day
- Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted descending by transactions
- Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions)

OBJECTIVE 3: BUILD A DYNAMIC DASHBOARD

- Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart
- Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the Pivot Table showing Top 15 product types
- Add a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet
- Adjust formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard (hide the raw PivotTables and remove the worksheet gridlines)

The Result:

The Structure
We have to file:
- Coffee Shop Sales file is the dataset we use for this project
- Coffee shop Dashboard is the Solution
